# DiCoW: Diarization-Conditioned Whisper for Target Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition

DiCoW (Diarization-Conditioned Whisper) enhances OpenAI’s Whisper ASR model by integrating **speaker diarization** for multi-speaker transcription. The app leverages `BUT-FIT/diarizen-wavlm-large-s80-mlc` to segment speakers and provides diarization-conditioned transcription for long-form audio inputs.

Training and inference source codes can be found here: [TS-ASR-Whisper](https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/TS-ASR-Whisper)

> **Note:** For the original v1 model, see the [`v1` branch](https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/DiCoW/tree/v1).

## Features

- **Multi-Speaker ASR**: Handles multi-speaker audio using diarization-aware transcription.  
- **Flexible Input Sources**:  
  - **Microphone**: Record and transcribe live audio.  
  - **Audio File Upload**: Upload pre-recorded audio files for transcription.  
  - **Folder Batch Processing** – Process multiple .wav files from a directory via the command line.
- **Diarization Support**: Powered by `BUT-FIT/diarizen-wavlm-large-s80-mlc` for accurate speaker segmentation.  
- **Built with 🤗 Transformers**: Uses the latest Whisper checkpoints for robust transcription.  

## Demo

### Online Usage
Run the app directly in your browser with [Gradio app](https://pccnect.fit.vutbr.cz/gradio-demo).

## Installation

### Requirements

Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.11**  
- **FFmpeg**: Required for audio processing.
- Python Libraries:  
  - `gradio`  
  - `transformers`  
  - `pyannote.audio`  
  - `torch`
  - `librosa`
  - `soundfile`

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:  
    ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/BUTSpeechFIT/DiCoW.git
   cd DiCoW  
    ```
2. Setup dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Clone DiariZen submodule:
   ```bash
   git submodule init
   git submodule update
   ```
4. Install the DiariZen dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd DiariZen
   cd pyannote-audio
   pip install -e .
   cd .. & cd ..
   ```
   
## Usage

### Web Interface

Run the application locally:  
```bash
  python app.py  
```

Once the server is running, access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:7860`.

### Processing a Folder of WAV Files (Command Line)

To process multiple `.wav` files at once, run:

```bash
python inference.py --input-folder /path/to/wav/files
```

### Linux service

If you want to run this demo on background, it may be good to make a service out of it. (some distros kill the background jobs when user logs out, hence kill the demo).

To register the demo as service, first edit `./run_server.sh` and `./DiCoW-background.service` and set proper paths and users. It is important to set the conda correctly in `./run_server.sh` 
as the service is started out of the userspace (`.profile`).

Then register and start the service (run as root):
```
systemctl enable ./DiCoW-background.service #register the service
systemctl start DiCoW-background.service #start
systemctl status DiCoW-background.service #check if it is running
systemctl stop DiCoW-background.service #stop
systemctl disable DiCoW-background.service #will not start on restart anymore
```

### Modes

1. **Microphone**: Use your device's microphone for live transcription.  
2. **Audio File Upload**: Upload pre-recorded audio files for diarization-conditioned transcription.
3. **Folder Batch Processing**: Process multiple WAV files from command line for automated workflows.
